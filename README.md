# Diabetes-Prediction-Dataset

My take on the 'Diabetes Prediction Dataset', as featured on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset).
I first started with Exploratory Data Analysis, and then moved onto analyzing what each and every feature would contribute to our dataset.
When tackling categorical features, I then used Chi Squared test in order to understand what features would be significant to our target variable.
Finally, I used a Random Forest Classifier model for training and to produce predictions related to the chance of getting diabetes according to the relevant features selected.
